# Contact Tracing using DB Scan Clustering

## Overview

This project aims to implement a contact tracing system using DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm. Contact tracing is a vital process in controlling the spread of infectious diseases, and clustering algorithms like DBSCAN can help identify close contacts efficiently in Bangalore.

## Features

- **DBSCAN Algorithm**: Utilizes the DBSCAN algorithm to cluster individuals based on their proximity and density of contact.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently, enabling contact tracing in densely populated areas.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows customization of DBSCAN parameters such as epsilon (radius) and minimum points, providing flexibility in defining contact thresholds.
- **Visualization**: Includes visualization tools to display clusters and contact networks, aiding in analysis and decision-making.
- **Data Privacy**: Prioritizes data privacy and security, ensuring sensitive information is handled with care and compliance with regulations.
